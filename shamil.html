          <p>Hey there!
            My full name is Shamil Babazada at the age of 17. Currently I am a freshman at ADA university and I am in IT faculty and I used to study at ADA school. I know 5 languages, them being Azeri, English, Russian, Turkish, and I learned German from my old school. Right now I am trying to learn Japanese. My hobbies are watching a lot of anime, play some games with friends, and sometimes when i get bored, I usually do some graphics designing. Currently I am trying to learn Blender and video editing with visual effects but it does take some time. Main reason of why I want to learn blender is because it is used for a lot of things that I can do for a hobby such as art, motion graphics, creating anything animated, and so on. When I was watching a TV show called "Who wants to be a millionaire" one of the questions was something about photoshop tools and after some research, I got excited to what I can do with it. </p>
