          <p>Hey there!
            Hey! My name is Ali. I’m 17. I’m bachelor of IT at ADA University. I am very interested in this field and amazed at its possibilities. I know four languages including Russian, Azerbaijani, English and German. At the moment, I would like to raise my German level, as I have not used it for a long time. From sports, I have been engaged in swimming for a long time and am satisfied with it until now. Also from the long sessions, I did gymnastics. I had experience in dancing, precisely in breakdancing. In terms of sports, I have always preferred basketball. In my free time I watch movies and TV series. However, spending free time with friends is more interesting for me. I love listening to music very much, and I spend most of the day wearing headphones. I don't have a favorite genre, because I listen to it depending on the quality itself. Also, I have always had an interest in everything new. For me, there is almost nothing boring or useless. As a result, I cling to something I like and try to find out as much as possible about it. I am quite sociable, calm, without prejudice, and try to remain neutral in any situation. </p>
